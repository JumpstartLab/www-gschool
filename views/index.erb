          <p>
            You'll be comfortable building real applications using <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML5</a>. At the halfway point of the program, we'll ask if you want to find a job after graduation...
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to work on <em>your own thing</em>, we'll set you off in the right direction with advice and connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to <em>get a job</em>, we'll help. If you participate in 75% of our "matchmaking" activities and graduate from the program, we'll help you find an offer as a full-time developer earning at least $60K in CO or the western region within 3 months of graduation &emdash; or we'll refund 100% of your tuition. <strong>Guaranteed.</strong>

          <p>Being a developer is more than the ability to program.</p>
          <p>
            You'll build complex projects including a data processing/mining system, a multi-tenant store platform, integrations with Github/Twitter/Facebook, a system of service-oriented applications, a project to support charity, and an independent mastery project. You'll build applications more advanced than many developers have <em>ever</em> built.

          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>
            Every weekday you'll have structured sessions 9AM-4PM including full-class instruction, hands-on workshops, code reviews, and guest speakers.
          </p>
          <p>
            You'll deliver presentations, contribute to open source, and participate in reading groups. On top of all that, you'll spend about 20 hours/week working in small groups on real projects. No moment goes to waste.
