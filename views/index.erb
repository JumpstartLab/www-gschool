          <p>
            You'll be comfortable building real applications using <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML5</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to <em>get a job</em>, we'll help you find one. All 24 students who started our Hungry Academy program finished with jobs at LivingSocial earning $75-95K. Prove yourself and great companies will be fighting for your services.
          <p>
            If you want to work on <em>your own thing</em>, we'll set you off in the right direction with advice and connections.

          <h2>Can I just read a book?</h2>
          <p>Being a developer is more than the ability to program.</p>
          <p>
            You'll build complex projects including a data processing/mining system, a multi-tenant store platform, integrations with Github/Twitter/Facebook, a system of service-oriented applications, a project to support charity, and an independent mastery project. You'll build applications more advanced than many developers have <em>ever</em> built.

        <div class="four">
          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>
            Every weekday you'll have structured sessions 9AM-4PM including full-class instruction, hands-on workshops, code reviews, and guest speakers.
          </p>
          <p>
            You'll deliver presentations, contribute to open source, and participate in reading groups. On top of all that, you'll spend about 20 hours/week working in small groups on real projects. No moment goes to waste.

There are programs that are cheaper and shorter. No other program can match the expertise you'll develop here.
